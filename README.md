## E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This is a project where I had to implement the models and the Javascript routes for a E-Commerce project that was already pre built. This project taught me a lot about mySQL databases and I also got experience using a new node package that was useful in debugging errors that were causing my routes to not work properly.

## Installation
You can source the schema in the mysql shell and then do a npm run seed to run the seed files and fill it with mock data, afterwards you can run node server.js and test the routes in insomnia.
